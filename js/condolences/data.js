        "I am grateful to have met Kuya Rey in Melbourne but was introduced to him previously via Facebook through my dad, Dan. When I met Kuya Rey in 2015 during my first trip to Australia, he greeted me at his home and provided me with such loving, touching insight into my dad and the Reataza family, who I had not been in contact with for years, especially after having moved to the US in 1991. I have always remembered Kuya Rey's kindness, tenderness, and authenticity, and he embodied those qualities in such a beautiful kind of strength. Condolences to the Mamon family.",
